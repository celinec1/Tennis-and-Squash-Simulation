# Tennis-and-Squash-Stimulation

# Project Description
## This project is a culmination of what we learned in our EC311 Intro to Logic Design.
## The tennis and squash simulation is a playable 1 or 2 player game that can be played on an FPGA board. The LED light represents the movement of a ball moving where with every hit, the ball speed increases. The tennis game is won by the first player to reach 3 points and the squash game is a continuous game which you try to reach the highest score possible.
